For example, flying across time zones or sleep loss can raise your blood pressure and glucose temporarily. That’s why we prefer to schedule tests after you’ve had at least 2 days of regular sleep and meals. Don’t worry — we’ll note any travel context when interpreting results ✅.",

Inflammatory markers (CRP, homocysteine) show whether your arteries are irritated. Hormones (thyroid, cortisol, testosterone) affect energy, weight, mood. Micronutrient levels tell us if your body is truly optimized.
