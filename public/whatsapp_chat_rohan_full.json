For example, flying across time zones or sleep loss can raise your blood pressure and glucose temporarily. That’s why we prefer to schedule tests after you’ve had at least 2 days of regular sleep and meals. Don’t worry — we’ll note any travel context when interpreting results ✅."

For example: ApoB and Lp(a) give us a more precise cardiovascular risk than LDL alone. Inflammatory markers (CRP, homocysteine) show whether your arteries are irritated. Hormones (thyroid, cortisol, testosterone) affect energy, weight, mood. Micronutrient levels tell us if your body is truly optimized. Think of it like looking at your health dashboard - we don’t just check fuel (cholesterol), we also check oil, brakes, and engine temperature."
