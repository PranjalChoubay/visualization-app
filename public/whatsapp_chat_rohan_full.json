For example: ApoB and Lp(a) give us a more precise cardiovascular risk than LDL alone. Inflammatory markers (CRP, homocysteine) show whether your arteries are irritated. Hormones (thyroid, cortisol, testosterone) affect energy, weight, mood. Micronutrient levels tell us if your body is truly optimized. Think of it like looking at your health dashboard - we don‚Äôt just check fuel (cholesterol), we also check oil, brakes, and engine temperature."
